# Unsupervised-learning-of-condition-invariant-images
#My work is inspired by the paper: "Unsupervised Online Learning of Condition-Invariant Images for Place Recognition" 
# In this task, initially i have used Alderly Day/Night dataset, which is available.
# Images are resized by 26*64 pixels
# for traing dataset 2500  images are being used, where first 1250 images are taken from Day dataset folder  and rest 1250 are taken from Night dataset forlder.
